LittleWigs


Description-

To put it simply, these are BigWigs modules that add some warnings to the bosses found in 5-man dungeons in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.


Usage-
Drop this folder into the Addons folder like any other addon.  It automatically integrates with BigWigs.

Should you not desire to even see some of the modules in the menu because you feel you don't want them, just delete the corresponding bosses .lua file or the entire instance folder.


Contributions-

If you would like to contribute you can do it in a few ways.
1) Download and install Transcriptor(http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/transcriptor.aspx), activate it when you start the boss fight and turn it off when you're done.  It will log all the necessary messages for creating new warnings.  Note: Not EVERYTHING can be warned, for example the mushrooms during Hungarfen in Underbog.
2) Write & Test the module yourself then send to me to include
3) Report any problems, inaccuracies, or suggestions you have to the wowace forum(http://forums.wowace.com/showthread.php?t=5564).
